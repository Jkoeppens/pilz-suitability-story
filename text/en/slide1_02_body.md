The **parasol mushroom** is a mushroom that many people are familiar with: it is large, **easy to recognize**, and a **popular edible mushroom**, whose cap is often prepared like a “steak.” In many areas, it can be reliably found in late summer and fall, but not everywhere.

Such differences exist for many mushroom species. Every year, collectors report thousands of finds, painting a rough picture of **when** and **where** mushrooms appear. But this picture is far from complete: **we find mushrooms mainly where we look for them.**

**Satellites, on the other hand, view landscapes differently.** They record the environmental conditions under which mushrooms could grow. These include **moisture, vegetation, and the structure of the landscape.**

This scrollytelling brings both perspectives together. It shows which patterns are biological and which mainly correspond to our search behavior. And it explores the question of whether this information is sufficient to predict the occurrence of mushrooms such as the parasol mushroom.
