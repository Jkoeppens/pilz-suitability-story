**The model applies its rules to the entire region.**
For each 10 × 10 meter grid, it estimates the suitability of the environmental conditions for finding mushrooms: from **low suitability (purple) to high suitability (yellow).**


This creates a **map of potential mushroom locations** that depends not on paths, but on vegetation, moisture, and spatial structure.
