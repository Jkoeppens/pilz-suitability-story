**The decision tree shows specific thresholds that the model uses to make distinctions.**

Each node represents a satellite value. The bar shows its intensity, and the number below it marks the point at which the tree splits between two paths.

Depending on which side of this threshold a location lies, the path branches off to the left or right. This results in different combinations of vegetation, moisture, and spatial structure.

The **leaves** are located at the bottom of the tree. They are color-coded and refer to the **suitability value**.

The scale ranges from **0 to 1**: **purple** stands for low suitability and **yellow** for high suitability as a typical mushroom location.
