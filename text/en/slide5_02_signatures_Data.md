**Satellites also see landscapes differently than the human eye.**

They measure not only **visible colors**, but also wavelengths from which ecological characteristics can be derived: how green the vegetation is or how moist an area appears.

These measurements are used to generate indicators such as the **vegetation index (NDVI)** or the **moisture index (NDWI)**. They describe where plants grow densely, where soils are moist—and where they are not.
 
Combining this information with its spatial arrangement **reveals where similar conditions form larger contiguous areas (clusters)** **and where conditions vary greatly within a small area (contrasts)**.

The combination of vegetation, moisture, and spatial structure thus creates **ecological signatures**.

**With the help of sensors that see differently than we do, satellites describe the landscape from a bird's-eye view.**
